# Elwin and Natalie - Coding Challenge

Welcome to our coding challenge!  Please continue reading to see how we completed the task.

### Task Requirements
- [x] Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
- [x] Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
- [x] Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
